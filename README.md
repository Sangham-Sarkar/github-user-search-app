## Overview
  A simple github user searcher using the githubs api
  
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process
First time working with an API, was mainly focused with processing the data and had a hard time working with the different mode but with some research was able to figure out how to make it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned

Understood about how data is sent and converted behind the scene and also understanding the importance of having backend knowledge.
